Development Dependencies (inside frontend folder)

Choose one NPM Live-server or Webpack

Live-server
Description: A quick way to preview the web application during development.
Installation: npm install -D live-server
Note: If your project does not involve JavaScript bundling or if you're working with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files without requiring advanced Webpack features.

Webpack
Description: Bundles JavaScript files and assets (CSS, images, fonts) into a single package.
Installation: npm install -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
Note: If you are using Webpack for bundling and development, including webpack-dev-server, you typically do not need to use live-server separately.
Latest version of webpack will not work on this project so for this one I used this in package.json to rollback and then reinstall again
 "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^4.47.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.3"
  }

then for the start in package.json add this
"start": "webpack-dev-server --watch-content-base --open"

or use this npm i webpack@4.47.0 webpack-cli@3.3.12 webpack-dev-server@3.11.3

Axios
Description: HTTP requests in JavaScript applications, providing a straightforward interface and robust functionality for dealing with network operations.
Installation: npm install axios
